# CountNumberOfRepitition
Count the number of times a letter appears in a word

Count the number of occurrences of a certain letter within a string. Our function will accept a parameter for a string and another for the character which we are going to count. For example, providing the word "mississippi" and the character 's' would result in an answer of 4. These are the steps we need to take:

Define the function to accept two parameters. word for the input string and x for the single character
Create a counter to keep track of the occurrences
Loop through every letter in the string. If the current letter is equal to the input letter, increase our counter
Return the counter after looping through the entire string.

Write a function named count_char_x that takes a string named word and a single character named x as parameters. The function should return the number of times x appears in word.
